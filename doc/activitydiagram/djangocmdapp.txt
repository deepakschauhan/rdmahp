***Creating App in django

Your apps can live anywhere on your Python path. In this tutorial, we'll create our poll app in the dsvvproject directory for simplicity.

To create your app, make sure you're in the dsvvproject directory and type this command:

 $ python manage.py startapp forms

That'll create a directory forms, which is laid out like this:
 forms/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py

this directory create new files
 new file name urls.py
