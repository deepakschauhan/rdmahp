Step 1 — Install Python and pip
*** To install Python we must first update the local APT repository. In your terminal window, we’ll input the command that follows. Note that the -y flag answers “yes” to prompts during the upgrade process. Remove the flag if you’d like the upgrade to stop for each prompt.

 $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y upgrade
 (yeh command apke system ko upadate kenr ke liye hain)

*** It is recommended by the Django Software Foundation to use Python 3, so once everything is updated, we can install Python 3 by using the following command: 

 $ sudo apt-get install python3

*** To verify the successful installation of Python 3, run a version check with the python3 command:

 $ python3 -V

*** The resulting output will look similar to this:
 Output
 python 3.5.2

*** Now that we have Python 3 installed, we will also need pip in order to install packages from PyPi, Python’s package repository.

 $ sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

*** To verify that pip was successfully installed, run the following command:
Output
pip 8.1.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages (python 3.5)

Step 2 — Install virtualenv

virtualenv is a virtual environment where you can install software and Python packages in a contained development space, which isolates the installed software and packages from the rest of your machine’s global environment. This convenient isolation prevents conflicting packages or software from interacting with each other.

To install virtualenv, we will use the pip3 command, as shown below:

   $ pip3 install virtualenv

Once it is installed, run a version check to verify that the installation has completed successfully:

   $ virtualenv --version

We should see the following output, or something similar:

Output
15.1.0

You have successfully installed virtualenv. 

Step 3 — Install Django

create folder 
 
    $ mkdir django-apps
    $ cd django-apps 

and this folder install django

$ pip install django


Once installed, verify your Django installation by running a version check:

$ django-admin --version

This, or something similar, will be the resulting output:

 Output
 2.0.1
